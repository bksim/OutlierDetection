				<p>Data used in the present study are a sample of the larger dataset used in <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/793/1/23">Nun et al. 2014</a>. <!--Briefly, the astronomical time series are from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) catalog, a collection of star observations from July 1992 to 1999. Regions of the sky surveyed include the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the Galactic bulge (<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/486/2/697">Alcock et al. 1997</a>).-->In particular, data was gathered through the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-III), an experiment primarily devoted to detecting gravitational microlensing events and transiting planets in the Galactic Bulge, the constellation Carina, and both Magellanic Clouds (Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud). Data was collected through OGLE-III throughout a period from 2001 until 2009; throughout years of monitoring, OGLE helped create the largest catalogs of variable stars, a portion of which we use in our project. Here, we focus on data from the LMC; data from the infrared (I) and visible (V) channels are used.</p>

				<p>
				Data from the OGLE-III LMC observations include light curves from nine different classes of objects. Descriptions of these classes and the amount of data used for each class are provided in the table below.

				</div>

				<p>Note that the R Coronae Borealis (rcb) variables are considered as outliers for our purposes. As noted above, these RCB variables are hydrogen-deficient, carbon and helium-rich, high-luminosity stars which belong to spectral types Bpe-C, which are simultaneously eruptive and pulsating variables. These stars show slow non-periodic fadings with rapid decline and slow recovery, combined with cyclic pulsations with amplitudes up to several tenths of a magnitude. Their high luminosity and combination of eruptive and pulsating variable characteristics, as well as the small number of this type of variable star catalogued in the OGLE-III experiment, led us to artificially tag this class as an outlier class. We hope that our outlier detection algorithms will be able to detect these differences, since there are very few R Coronae Borealis variables in our dataset as compared to objects in other classes.
				</p>

				<p>The first step of the outlier detection process is performing dimensionality reduction on the astronomical time series dataset described above. Each time series is reduced into a 57-dimensional feature vector, with features calculated using the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/FATS/1.2.0">FATS time series analysis library</a>. (We also contributed new features to this library.) A list of the features used is provided in the table below, and further documentation regarding the specific features used can be found in the library and in our code. These features were calculated on the <a href="https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/odyssey/">Harvard Odyssey Cluster</a> in parallel, since the cluster had infrastructure for parallelization.

				<p class="caption"><strong>Table D1. Timeseries features and citations in the FATS library.</strong> These 57 features were calculated for the light curve timeseries data.</p>

				<p>As part of this project, we made contributions to the FATS library, creating 24 features representing the amplitudes and phases of various Lomb-Scargle-periodogram deduced frequencies and harmonics. These 24 features are included in our 57-dimensional feature space.</p>

				 <p>To train the mixture of experts model, a sample of 1913 light curves were used: 296 from lpv, 293 from dsct, 297 from ecl, 202 from t2cep, 294 from cep, 82 from acep, 291 from rrlyr, and 22 from rcb. Light curves were used only if there was data from both the I and the V channels. </p>

				<h5>Data Visualization</h5>
				<p>To visualize the 57-dimension data points more easily, principal component analysis (PCA) was done on the extracted time series features for each light curve. The first two principal components were used to make a 2D plot (Figure D1). PCA was used because visualizing a 57-dimensional space on a 2D image is very difficult. One could imagine plotting the data points on axes of each pair of features. However, this would create too many (57 choose 2) plots and therefore would be hard to easily grasp the shape of the data point cloud. PCA is a great way to draw a plane through the 57-dimensional data point cloud in such a way that the plane captures the most variation in the data. Projecting the data points on this place thus may allow visualization of outlier points more easily. We note that PCA was solely used as a visualization tool, and was not used for any of the mathematical mechanics in building the outlier detection models. </p>

				<p class="caption"><strong>Figure D1. Light curves in the PCA plane.</strong> Principal component analysis (PCA) was done on the extracted time series features for each light curve. Each dot represents a light curve. The color represents the known class labels of the light curve. Time series data from the visible (V) (top) and infrared (I) (bottom)channels are shown.</p>

				<p>As can be seen, the rcb class appears to be the most outlierly, with points spread out across the PCA plane, separated from the main cluster of points in the other classes. This was the reason we chose to use the rcb class to test our outlier detection methods.</p>



				<h5>Initial Exploration</h5>
				<p>We started our exploration by plotting the light curves in feature space, projected onto two feature axes at a time. We might be curious at seeing whether some of the outliers detected by our methodology show up as obvious visual outliers in projected two-dimensional feature space. Below are some of the plots generated by projecting the light curves onto various combinations of two features.</p>

				<p class="caption"><strong>Figure D4. Light curve data projected onto Amplitude and Frequency axes.</strong></p>

				<p>One might expect that the points which are far away from the clusters of points might be denoted as outliers. Indeed, running preliminary single-expert models on the data and generating the same graphs confirms our intuition: the points in red on the plots below are outliers marked by single-expert models. Note that they seem to be far from the other points (in general) in the projections selected. Click on each image and then use the left and right arrow keys to clearly switch between the original projection and the projection marked by outliers.</p>
