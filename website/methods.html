			<h3>About Skeleton?</h3>
			<p>Skeleton is a small collection of well-organized CSS files that can help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone. It's based on a responsive grid, but also provides very basic CSS for typography, buttons, forms and media queries. Go ahead, resize this super basic page to see the grid in action.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="one-third column">
			<h3>Three Core Principles</h3>
			<p>Skeleton is built on three core principles:</p>
			<ul class="square">
				<li><strong>A Responsive Grid Down To Mobile</strong>: Elegant scaling from a browser to tablets to mobile.</li>
				<li><strong>Fast to Start</strong>: It's a tool for rapid development with best practices</li>
				<li><strong>Style Agnostic</strong>: It provides the most basic, beautiful styles, but is meant to be overwritten.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="one-third column">
			<h3>Docs &amp; Support</h3>
			<p>The easiest way to really get started with Skeleton is to check out the full docs and info at <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com">www.getskeleton.com.</a>. Skeleton is also open-source and has a <a href="https://github.com/dhgamache/skeleton">project on git</a>, so check that out if you want to report bugs or create a pull request. If you have any questions, thoughts, concerns or feedback, please don't hesitate to email me at <a href="mailto:hi@getskeleton.com">hi@getskeleton.com</a>.</p>

			<h4 class="title">Previous Work &amp; Methods</h4>
			<p>The Mixture of Experts approach gets its strength from combining the output of separate methods (experts) having presumably different regimes of expertise.</p>

			<p>In this project, five oulier detection methods (modified and/or unmodified from previous work) were used on either the infrared (I) or visual (V) channels of the light curves. This gave a total of ten experts (five methods on two different channels). Here, we describe each outlier detection method and show its stand-alone performance. </p>

			<p>We measure performance using two metrics. First, an artificial set of outliers are created (see below) and the method's ability to score them as outliers is measured. In the second method, we choose a class ('rcb') that is designated as outlier (based on initial data exploration). We then evaulate how well the method can score objects in this class as outliers. </p>

			<h5>Creation of Artificial Outliers</h5>
			<p>20 artificial outliers were created by first randomly sampling 20 light curves from the data set. Within each feature, the 20 values were randomly shuffled among the data points. Then, $n$ standard deviations (of each feature) were randomly added to each data value, where $n$ is selected from a standard normal distribution centered at 4. Figure P1 shows the outliers plotted on the PCA plane.</p>

			<p class="caption"><strong>Figure M1. Artificial Outliers on the PCA plane, along with real data.</strong> 20 Artificial outliers (white dots, black outline) were created as described. The outliers do not seem too far removed from the main cluster of points on the PCA plane, indicating that measuring outlier detection performance with these artificial points will provide a good test of robustness of each method. </p>

			<h5>Support Vector Machine &amp; Joint Probability (SVM+JP)</h5>
			<p>This is a supervised learning method modified from <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/793/1/23">Nun et al. 2014</a>. Breifly, a classifier is trained on data of known labeled classes. A vector of probability is produced for each point that lists the probability of its belonging to each class. Then a joint probability for the particular combination of membership probabilities is calculated.  Nun et al. used a random forest classifier and a Bayesian Network to produce the probabilities. </p>
			<p>Here, we modify the approach by using SVM for the classifier and a joint probability table to determine the joint probabilities.</p>
