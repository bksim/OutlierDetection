				<h4 class="title">Previous Work &amp; Methods</h4>
				<p>The Mixture of expertss approach gets its strength from combining the output of separate methods (experts) having presumably different regimes of expertise.</p>

				<p>In this project, five outlier detection methods (modified and/or unmodified from previous work) were used on either the infrared (I) or visual (V) channels of the light curves. This gave a total of ten experts (five methods on two different channels). Here, we describe each outlier detection method and show its stand-alone performance. </p>

				<p>We measure performance using two metrics. First, an artificial set of outliers are created (see below) and the method's ability to score them as outliers is measured. In the second method, we choose a class ('rcb') that is designated as outlier (based on initial data exploration). We then evaulate how well the method can score objects in this class as outliers. </p>

				<h5>Creation of Artificial Outliers</h5>
				<p>20 artificial outliers were created by first randomly sampling 20 light curves from the data set. Within each feature, the 20 values were randomly shuffled among the data points. Then, $n$ standard deviations (of each feature) were randomly added to each data value, where $n$ is selected from a standard normal distribution centered at 4. Figure P1 shows the outliers plotted on the PCA plane.</p>

				<p class="caption"><strong>Figure P1. Artificial Outliers on the PCA plane, along with real data.</strong> 20 Artificial outliers (white dots, black outline) were created as described. The outliers do not seem too far removed from the main cluster of points on the PCA plane, indicating that measuring outlier detection performance with these artificial points will provide a good test of robustness of each method. </p>

				<h5>K Nearest Neighbors 1 (KNN1)</h5>
				<p>Modified from standard KNN approaches descrbied in outlier detection and classfication review literature such as <a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/767/1/hodgevj4.pdf">Hodge and Austin. 2004</a>. For every point, we compute a score which is the number of neighboring points that exist within a certain curoff distance chosen as a parameter. The distance in $n$-dimensions is merely the Euclidean norm but could be replaced by others. </p>
				<p> When computing all neighbors for each point, this becomes a $O(n^2)$ problem.  In implementation there are ways to simplify these computations using $kd$-trees and other algorithms but this is abstracted for us by usage of the functions provided for KNN in the scikitlearn library.
				</p>
				<p> Using this method, there are a couple ways to evaluate outliers. The first would be to assume that the scores of KNN1 (the number of neighbors) are distributed normally such that we could filter based on a certain standard deviation count. Another option would be using the threshold parameter to find the $n$ most outliered points which can be labelled as outliers though this approach would work best by requiring a large understanding of the problem and an assumption on outlier likelihood.
				</p>
				<p> KNN methods are geometric - computed with scores usually based on Euclidean norms. This translates to a density-based outlier detection meaning that two very similarly in density classes or an outlier in the middle of existing classes may return false positives without a careful tuning of the cutoff distance parameter. In higher dimensions, using paired dimensions and multiple pairings can help highlight differences that exist only in single dimensions that would have otherwise averaged out but this trades off computation (O(n^4) naively since there are now ${n \choose 2}$ pairwise dimensions to evaluate all $n$ points.)

				<p class="caption"><strong>Figure P2. Visual representation .</strong> In a visualization to see how a KNN scoring method would work under this first version, we see how for a given point in question (the smiley face) it counts all neighbors within a cutoff distance (the solid or dotted circles).  Although the visualization is in the supervised classification context, this cutoff radius and neighbor counting is analagous in the unsupervised outlier detection context. </p>

				<p class="caption"><strong>Figure P3. ROC for the KNN1 method.</strong> The ROC curves shows that this method works well espescially for the RCB outlier class.  We see an fairly optimal curve and this validates our hypothesis that a simple geometric approach may lead to positive results. The artificial outlier class is not as easily detected.</p>


				<h5>K Nearest Neighbors 2 (KNN2)</h5>
				<p>As with the other KNN algorithm (KNN1) this version is also discussed in standard classification/outlier detection approaches as in <a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/767/1/hodgevj4.pdf">Hodge and Austin. 2004</a>. As opposed to using a Euclidean-norm cutoff distance in $n$-dimensions, the given parameter, $n$, is the number of neighbors to compute. Then, the Euclidean-norm score is computed to all of the $n$ nearest neighbors. The total distance (which should be monotonically increasing) will be the score for each point. </p>
				<p> The computation order is similarly $O(n^2)$ which when computed with different data structures like $kd$-trees can be optimized. The process of labelling outliers is also as above - be it with the assumption of normally distributed scores with a standard deviation cutoff, or tuning the parameters to select a certain proportion of possible outliers. The weakness of KNN2 is the same as KNN1 in that KNN-based methods are geometric and density based, as described above.  The problem is solved with pairwise analysis in higher dimensionality but this leads to a tradeoff with increasingly difficult computation.

				<h5>Support Vector Machine &amp; Joint Probability (SVM+JP)</h5>
				<p>This is a supervised learning method modified from <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/793/1/23">Nun et al. 2014</a> and documented by supervised-learning standard algorithms. Briefly, a classifier is trained on data with known class labels. For each point, a membership probability vector is produced that lists the probability of its belonging to each class. Then a joint probability for the particular combination of membership probabilities is calculated.  Nun et al. used a random forest classifier and a Bayesian Network to produce the joint probabilities. Outliers are then identified as the points that have low joint probabilities because class membership probability vectors similar to thiers were not been seen often enough in the training data. </p>
				<p>Here, we modify the approach by using SVM (rbf kernel) for the classifier and a frequency table to determine the joint probabilities. In addition, an artificial class sampled uniformly from the sample space was used to train the classifier. The outlier class combined used in conjuction with the rbf kernel SVM allowed the method to create bounded regions for each class even with a very small number randomly sampled background. These modifications were found to improve outlier detection (especially excluded-group outliers).  We can see a small-scale example on the classic "Iris" data set, below. </p>
				<p>SVM was used instead of random forest because it can draws neater and tighter decision boundaries around clusters of points. This is necessary because outliers can be positioned far away from the initial training data points, yet be classified under a particular class solely due to its position radial to a class decision space. We found that the SVM classifier, with decision boundaries that encompass well the clusters of points for each particular class, improves detection of these kinds of outliers. </p>

				<h5>Local Correlation Integral (LoCI)</h5>
				<p>Modified from <a href="http://www.intel-research.net/Publications/Pittsburgh/081620021325_99.pdf">Papadimitriou et al. 2003.</a></p>
				<p>LOCI provides an automatic, data-dictated cutoff to determine whether a point is an outlier, with very few hyperparameters forcing users to pick arbitrary cut-offs. In addition, LOCI is quickly computable (compared to previous best methods) and approximate LOCI is practically linear in time. The algorithm involves the introduction of a multi-granularity deviation factor (MDEF), and then selecting a point as an outlier if its MDEF value deviates significantly (more than 3 $\sigma$ from local averages). Intuitively, the LOCI method finds points that deviate significantly from the density of points in its local neighborhood. This is formalized in the MDEF concept. Let the $r$-neighborhood of an object $p_i$ be the set of objects within distance $r$ of $p_i$. Then, intuitively, the MDEF at radius $r$ for a point $p_i$ is the relative deviation of its local neighborhood density from the average local neighborhood density in its $r$-neighborhood. So, an object with neighborhood density that matches the average local neighborhood density will have MDEF 0; outliers will have MDEFs far from 0. More formally, we have:

				$$MDEF(p_i, r, \alpha) = 1 - \frac{n(p_i, \alpha r)}{\hat{n}(p_i, \alpha, r)}$$

Here, $n(p_i, \alpha r)$ is the number of $\alpha r$-neighbors of $p_i$; that is, the number of points $p\in \mathbb{P}$ such that $d(p_i, p) \leq \alpha r$, including $p_i$ itself such that $n(p_i, \alpha r) > 0$ strictly.

Also, $\hat{n}(p_i, \alpha, r)$ is the average of $n(p, \alpha r)$ over the set of $r$-neighbors of $p_i$; that is,

$$\hat{n}(p_i, \alpha, r) = \frac{\sum_{p\in\mathcal{N}(p_i, r)} n(p, \alpha r)}{n(p_i, r)}$$

Also, define

$$\sigma_{MDEF}(p_i, r, \alpha)= \frac{\sigma_{\hat{n}}(p_i, r, \alpha)}{\hat{n}(p_i, r, \alpha)}$$


where

$$\sigma_{\hat{n}}(p_i, r, \alpha) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{p\in\mathcal{N}(p_i, r)}(n(p, \alpha r)-\hat{n}(p_i, r, \alpha))^2}{n(p_i, r)}}$$

Then, to determine if a point is an outlier, we use the following algorithm. For each $p_i\in\mathbb{P}$, compute $MDEF(p_i, r, \alpha)$ and $\sigma_{MDEF}(p_i, r, \alpha)$. If $MDEF > 3\sigma_{MDEF}$, flag $p_i$ as an outlier. If for any $r_{\textrm{min}} \leq r \leq r_{\textrm{max}}$ a point $p_i$ is flagged as an outlier via the aforementioned mechanism, then we consider that point to be an outlier. These cutoffs can be determined on a per-problem basis, but in general we use the following. We set $r_{\textrm{max}} \approx \alpha^{-1}R_{\mathbb{P}}$ and $r_{\textrm{min}}$ such that we have $\hat{n}_{\textrm{min}} = 20$ neighbors.

				<h5>Mixture Model (Eskin)</h5>
				<p>Modified from <a href="http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:125814/CONTENT/anomaly-icml00.pdf">Eskin, 2000</a>. The main goal behind the mixture model is to simplify a more complicated interaction to a combination of simpler distributions. Outlier classification is done by first assuming that all points belong in the normal group - and then computing a T-statistic to compute the probaiblity of observing this grouping.  Then, for every orderm, $k$, (we only implemented order-1 where $k=1$), we iterate through the ${n \choose k}$ space to move $k$ points into the outlier class, which is usually assumed to be uniform.  Then the scores of the new grouping is computed. If the change in score is past a given threshold, the $k$ points are marked as outliers in that order of space. In summary, for order-1, each point is moved from the normal to the outlier class and if the scores improve under this grouping beyond a certain threshold, the point is accepted as an ourlier. This does mean that optimizing for the theshold parameter can only be performed to target a certain number of outliers, again requiring additional knowledge. For computational efficiency, often the scoring is based on $\log$ scores.</p>

				<p> The are three main assumptions that allow this Eskin approach to work the best. First, that the normal data can be fairly modelled by the given probability distribution. Second, that the anomalous elements are sufficiently distinct from the normal elements. And finally, that anomalies are few ($< 5\%$) of the entire data set or else the model will get distorted.
				</p>


				<p> An analysis of the math of the method is described now.  We let $D$ represent the generative distribution of the entire data, $M$ the majority distribution, $A$ the anomalous distribution, $\lambda$ the probability of an anomalous element generated from A and $(1-\lambda)$ the probability of a normal element generated from M.
				</p>

				<p> We write the generalized distribtuion as: <br /> $D = (1-\lambda)M + \lambda A$
				</p>

				<p> The probability distribution generation with function $\Phi$: <br />$P_{M_t}(X) = \Phi_M(M_t)(X)$ <br />$P_{A_t}(X) = \Phi_A(A_t)(X)$
				</p>

				<p> The likelihood of the distribution: <br />$L_t(D) = \prod_{i=1}^{N}P_D(x_i) = \left( (1-\lambda)^{|M_t|} \prod_{x_i \in M_t}P_{M_t}(x_i) \right) \left( \lambda^{|A_t|} \prod_{x_j \in A_t}P_{A_t}(x_j) \right)$
				</p>

				<p> The $\log$ of the above likelihood for computational speed: <br />$LL_i(D) = |M_t| \log (1-\lambda) + \sum _{x_i \in M_i} \log (P_{M_i}(x_i)) + |A_t| \log (\lambda) + \sum _{x_j \in A_t} \log (P_{A_t}(x_j))$
				</p>

				<p> Treating $x_i$ as an anomaly: <br />$M_t = M_{t-1} \backslash {x_t}$ <br /> $A_t = A_{t-1} \cup {x_t}$
				</p>

				<p> To determine outliers, we then use the score cutoff, $c$ to select, via: <br />$LL_t - LL_{t-1} < c$
				</p>

				<p> The greatest weakness of the mixture model is its dependence on the underlying simple models that form the mixture. This means that the normal points need to follow a known distribution that can lead to a computed t-statistics (can be joint distributions, etc). When in doubt, a Gaussian model can be used but the results would be less accurate and precise
